Yeah like remove the "-template" in "config-template.json" to make it work

Default config:

	"token" : "",
	"prefix" : "arm",
	"botOwnerId" : "704011737900253315",
	"embedAccent" : "#ff0000",
	"embedFooter" : "Discord: Madas#6125 Twitter: @_madas_",
	"botName" : "ArmBot"
	}

 - Prefix - The prefix you want for each command
 - botOwnerId - Your [user id](https://madas.xyz/how2getdiscordid) 
 - embedAccent - The colour used for the bar of the left side in embeds
 - embedFooter - footer used in embeds

## Why did i keep this piece of shit?
imo it feels great to look back at old code and just laugh at how much you didnt understand.
Its funny cause like i didnt understand some js operators, had inconsistent indentation and like the best part is that i made all of this in notepad++ cause i didnt know vscode existed cause i thought it was paid like everything else made by microsoft.
